* Distributed friendliness: Permanently distributed, just pandemic-distributed, in-office or blend.
* Location and timezone expectations: US-only? West Coast preferred? Some other arrangement?
* Your (the job poster) relation to this position: Are you the hiring manager? The recruiter? Or someone else?
* Does your company provide Visa sponsorship?
