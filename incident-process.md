When an incident occurs, I ask that per the Code of Conduct for those involved to resolve peacefully:

“If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.”

This is easier said than done, but this is Leadership Slack. My expectation is that everyone here is hoping to learn about the craft of leadership; peaceful resolution of complex human situation is leadership 101.

However, resolution amongst the individuals will not always be achievable. In this case, the reporter of the incident has a choice. They can immediately raise the incident to me (see below for specifics) or they can share the incident with #rands-slack-rules and seek feedback and perhaps resolution on the incident. I understand the need for the former workflow, but I highly encourage the latter because, again, this is a leadership Slack. My hope is that the debate will help educate this sub-community of humans interested in the rules and culture that govern this small corner of the Internet. 

When ready and if appropriate, the reporter needs to send me a direct message. Based on past incidents, there are at least four things I need to understand:

1. What’s the nature of the incident and/or CoC violation? 
2. Who is involved in this incident?
3. What material supports this situation?
4. Any privacy concerns? (The reporter may choose to keep the incident private.)

With this information in hand, I will strive to respond to the reporter as quickly as possible with an estimate of when I think I’ll be able to triage and resolve this incident. In extreme cases, I may suspend one or more accounts until I am able to triage and resolve an incident. 

Based on past experiences, incident resolution can vary from hours to days depending on the availability of those involved. Once the incident is resolved, I will communicate the resolution to the reporter and other other parties relevant to the incident. In extreme cases, I will communicate the resolution with #rands-slack-rules with reporter permission.

You have questions:

- “Is situation XYZ an incident?” Unsure if there’s a CoC violation? Ask #rands-slack-rules and/or DM me. We'll help.
- “Are we still updating the Code of Conduct?” Yes, but including this entire incident process did not fit the intent of the CoC. The revised CoC will refer to this process. 
- “How many incidents have you handled since this place started?” Six as of 2017-10-25.
