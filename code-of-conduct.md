All participants in the Rands Leadership Slack are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct. Administrators (see below for definition of Administrators) will enforce this code throughout the Rands Leadership Slack.

# The Short Version

Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered; respect privacy; understand we’re mostly not-for-profit; and if you can’t resolve an issue with someone else you should contact the Administrators. If you are being a problem, it will be made clear to you, and you may be asked to leave the Rands Leadership Slack.

# The Long Version

## Respect

The Rands Leadership Slack is an intentionally positive online community dedicated to developing the craft of leadership. We recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of our independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to your community. 

The Rands Leadership Slack is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the Administrators. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
* Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it. 

Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the discretion of the Administrators.

## Privacy

This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed an non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.

If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule) as the guideline (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”).

For attribution of specific content found on this Slack, we ask that you ask the originator of the content for permission. If you don’t receive consent in a reasonable period of time, we ask that you credit the “Rands Leadership Slack.”

## Read the Room

This is large community with a great many different humans populating hundreds of channels. Different channels have organically developed different personalities. We suggest that before posting in a channel with hundreds of members that you take the time read the room. Specifically:

* Read the last couple days of messages.
* Examine the channel topic for helpful tips.
* Click on the channel details and read the about section, get a sense for how many members are present, and what messages have already been pinned and what files have been shared.

## Not For Profit (Mostly)

While this community is designed to help aspects of leadership, and that frequently benefit whatever company or individual a member is currently working for, this is not a place for obvious commercial activities such as recruiting, marketing, or other solicitation, except in channels dedicated to that purpose.

If you join this community simply to take value rather than contribute, the community will quickly notice and react. If you are wondering whether a specific action is commercial or not, please ask in channel and/or calibrate in one of the the channels dedicated to helping people find their way (#how-to-rands or #rands-slack-rules).

Non-obvious commercial activity includes (but is not limited to) well-intentioned user surveys of a specific channel or responding to a request for tools or services with information about company.  In these situations, we ask that you:

* Ask permission of the channel *before* posting the solicitation or information
* State clear intent for the purpose
* **Listen** to the response of your peers in channel

We believe this protocol is generally useful for all commercial requests and should be used when there are any doubts regarding commercial activity.

Examples of channels which explicitly allow commercial activity include:

* #conferences
* #consulting-gigs
* #forsale
* #ibuiltsomething
* #iwrotesomething
* #jobs
* #remote-jobs
* #services
* #wedidit

Some geographically-focused channels have a higher tolerance for specific kinds of commercial activity focused on events based in that region. We recommend the above asking protocol.

In channels where commercial activity is allowed, it is just as unwelcome to post an unrelated commercial offering as it is to post in non-commercial channels.

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an Administrator. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.

## Consequences

If you feel a message should be deleted, please refer to our overview of [Deleting Content](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/master/deleting-content.md).

If you are unable to resolve a situation peacefully, please refer to our [Incident Process](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/master/incident-process.md) and choose a course of action that suits the situation.

If the Administrators determine that a human is violating any part of this Code of Conduct, the Administrators may take any action they deem appropriate within this Slack team, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Rands Leadership Slack. 

As Administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the Administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.
