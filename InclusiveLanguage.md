The Rands Leadership Slack has a Slackbot that automatically flags non-inclusive words and phrases and makes alternate suggestions.

In partnership with [Better Allies](https://betterallies.com), we decided to share our inclusive language Slackbot rules so that administrators of other Slack communities can copy or modify them.

For simple instructions on how to download the rules and customize a Slack workspace, please refer to [this page](https://betterallies.com/language/).
